VERSION: 0.7.2

Changes since 0.7.1:
- fixed issues that prevented sample app from working against Grails 1.1.1
- Checked in associated sample app code into source control, and documented the creation of the sample app.

Changes since 0.7:
- Update to Grails 1.1
- Doh!  Forgot to make the create view also use Dojo.

Changes since 0.6.1:
- fixed action.gsp for international use (bug identified by Guido Schoepp)
- added new "dojo" AJAX skin - uses the Dojo 0.4.3 toolkit, and degrades smoothly 
to HTML/CSS when JS is disabled.  Note that Dojo should be installed under 
web-app/js/dojo.
- scaffold-skins are moved to src/skins because of plugin changes
- renamed install-scaffold-skin script as install-skin
- released with new SVN structure

Changes since 0.6(b):
- double-oops.  Fixed NPE when scaffold-skins directory doesn't exist in the app.

Changes since 0.6 (original):
- oops.  Didn't properly clean up the package before putting it into distribution.
- moved skins to scaffold-skins; added support in install-scaffold-skin script
for installing skins from an application's scaffold-skins directory; 
note that an application's skins will override those of the plugin.
(yep, this is related to the first item).

Changes since 0.5.1:
- added <g:renderAction> and <g:renderActions> to support flexible 
rendering of the actions available, using an action.gsp template
- added missing Calendar renderer for list view
- added support for skins!  Initial skins are:
	* the old renderers that look like the default Grails scaffolding
	* a prettier HTML-only no-image set
- there are no default renderers installed; you MUST install a skin 
prior to using ScaffoldTags.  Overwrite-detection is improved.
- updated for Grails 0.5 (Groovy upgrade, GSP Dynamic taglib output, and resource loading changes)
- added support for a domain widget parameter for <g:renderDomain>
- created support for linked properties in no-img-skin's list view via a link style for each property

Changes since 0.5:
- fix to install-scaffold-tags-views script
- updated to address Grails 0.5 internal API changes

Changes since 0.4:
- fixed various parts of tag API documentation
- checked into Grails Plugin SVN
- refactored templates to use "widget" templates.  
If you've been relying upon the style attribute map to specify a widget value, 
please use the widget attribute instead for a single value, 
or the widgets attribute to specify a map of fields to widgets.
If you've installed the scaffold renderers, you will need to either
overwrite them with a re-install, or update them.
- reduced # of places I have to edit the plugin version number; still ugly
- removed installation script for default renderers as this is no longer 
recommended usage.
- added support for Interface renderers!
- added simple Map and Collection renderers, with embedded behavior support.

Changes since 0.3:
- added support for specifying domains, types, and properties by name to 
 permit greater ease and flexibility in the display of domain renderers
- added g:eachProperty, to assist the generation of bean renderers 
(sorry, still no support for interfaces yet...)
- added support for inherited associations
- fixed one-many editor scaffold template
- fixed Calendar editor style behavior to be consistent with Date
- added documentation on tags, templates, and behaviors
- fixed bug in TimeZone editor; but won't really work until g:timeZoneSelect is fixed
- fixed show template for java.util.Calendar

Changes since 0.2:
- fixed various many-many editing issues
- added support for embedded widget style in show & list templates
- modified how many-type relationships submit data

Changes since 0.1:
- added support for many-many embedded editing
- added support for readonly in more cases
- improved association handling
- added sample application

Changes since early Scaffold2 releases:
- split up plugin into DjangoTemplates, GroovyBinder, and ScaffoldTags 
in order to increase reusability
	- DjangoTemplates only captures the Django block tags
	- ScaffoldTags only handles the views for domain objects using a taglib
	framework and supporting replacement view scaffolding templates.
	- GroovyBinder handles binding side of domain objects; acts as a 
	workaround to lack of proper many-many support in 0.4.2 but does
	not require significant changes to individual controllers, unlike
	earlier Scaffold2 release.
